**Test - Proof of Concept , Blog in Laravel**

This is the code behind [OMI-Blog](https://blog.omi.nz/ "OMI-Blog")
It was originally built as a demo for using Laravel in a real-world application.
Over time it turned into a fully functional Blog and is still being built on.

Technologies used thus far:
- Laravel
- TinyMCE
- Axios
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Parsley.js


## Pre-requisites

- MySQL
- PHP 7.4 with 'php7.4' as the path
 (this was back back then!)
- Composer v1
- Git

## Installation

`composer create-project sirjeff/larablog /FULL-PATH-TO-BLOG/ 1.2.6`

[Please see 'Install_and_Setup'](Install_and_Setup.md)

## To-Do

There's a lot more to do.

Please "Watch" this project to keep an eye on things.

I will be adding some new features, and making the blog look a bit nicer.
