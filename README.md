# larablog

Test - Proof of Concept , Blog in Laravel
This is the MySQL version, and will soon release a MongoDB version.
Also note the original demo was for Figured - which will be removed from the sorce ... eventually.

## Instalation

Currently (as this is still in 'dev') you can use:

`composer create-project --stability dev sirjeff/larablog /PATHTOBLOG/larablog`

I have different distros of PHP on my Windows dev. machine, therfore I am using PHP in the CLI, e.g. :

`C:/home/wamp/bin/php/php7.0.10/php.exe c:/bin/composer/composer.phar create-project --stability dev sirjeff/larablog c:/home/larablog`
